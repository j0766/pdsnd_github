### Project Title
Interactive Bikeshare analysis

### Description
The project allows the user to select the specific data set, the way of filtering (by month, day of the week, both or none) and then provides a number of different analysis screens as well as access to sample data.

### Files used
Apart from the code bikeshare.py, the project also requires three data files namely chicago.csv, new_york_city.csv and washington.csv

### Credits
Apart from the idea and course materials from Udacity, I also obtained a code snippet obtained from https://www.w3resource.com/python-exercises/python-basic-exercise-65.php and modified to suit.  The code was for a custom function called seconds_to_datestamp(input_seconds)
